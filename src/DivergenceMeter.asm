;    0.3  (2/1)  Testing animation of number.                         *

;    0.44 (2/13) Worked on long/short button pushes.                  *
;    0.45 (2/15) Adding I2C to talk to DS1307 Real-time Clock chip    *
;         using Andrew D. Vassallo's bit banging from piclist.com     *
;         (2/17) Works. Long time debugging since it apparently       *

;    0.6  (2/19) Clock works. Working on settings interface.          *
;    0.7  (2/21) Basic settings done: Time / Date / Brightness.       *
;    0.75 (2/22) Added preset world lines from anime/visual novel.    *
;    0.8  (2/25) Added manual world line entry. Added random beta     *
;         and neg. world lines. Put useful things in subroutines.     *
;    0.85 (2/27) Date format pref (MM DD YY or DD MM YY) done.        *

;         the value stored in EEPROM location 7F.                     *
;    1.02 (3/30) Changed so the device starts up in clock mode.       *
;         Mainly because if there is a power outage, you don't        *
;         want the device to wake up and stay with one number on      *
;         the nixie tubes for an extended period.                     *
;    1.03 (4/20) Fixed error in Year-setting routine.                 *
;    1.04 (5/11) Fixed error in error routine that reports "666"      *
;         if the clock chip does not respond. This did not work       *
;         right at power-up because the tube power was still off,     *
;         so I added lines to turn tubes on to the error handler.     *
;         ALSO added version number display. The version number       *
;         will be displayed as long as switch 2 is held on the way    *
;         into the Settings menu.                                     *
;    1.05 (5/12) Works for either DS1307 or DS3232 clock chips.       *

; Define port pins for I2C access of DS1307: SCL clock line is RA0. SDA data line is RA1.
; The lines have 10K pullup resistors and will be used in passive control mode where the outputs
; are set to zero, and then controlled by setting and clearing TRISA,0 and TRISA,1. Setting TRIS
; bit high will make pin an input, and the resistor will pull the line connected to that high-Z
; pin high (1). Clearing TRIS bit makes pin an output, and the zero will be output to make the
; line low (0). This must be done in Bank1 where the TRIS register can be accessed. Why all this?
; Because this way the I2C slave (DS1307) can pull the high line low in response.
; Where the assembler sees the symbols defined below, they are the same as the "TRISA,n" stuff 
; (or as "PORTA,n" in Bank0).
